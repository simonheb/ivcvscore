### <a name="3arms"></a>I have 3 treatment arms. How do I use `ritest`?
Setup: There are three treatment arms (0=Control, 1=Treatment A, 2=Treatment B).

What do yo want to test? David McKenzie has a short discussion of this [here](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/finally-way-do-easy-randomization-inference-stata). In short, there are three main hypotheses one might want to test. (a) Treatment A is no different from Control, (b) Treatment B is no different from Controls and (c) the two treatments are indistinguishable.

Here give an example for (a). (b) and (c) are conducted analogously. First, make sure that you define a single treatment varaible that encodes all three cases as above. Then you can either run:

```
ritest treatment _b[1.treatment], .... : reg y i.treatment if treatment != 2
```
or
```
ritest treatment _b[1.treatment], fixlevels(2)  .... : reg y i.treatment
```
(for this you'll need the latest version of `ritest`)

The two variants are slightly different. The first one completely drops observations of Treatment B, assuming they are useless for identifying differences between Treatment A and control. The second one keeps these observations in the estimation sample, but excludes them from the re-randomization. Keeping them in the estimation and re-randomization would make no sense, as this would pool Treatment B and the control group and thus test a weird hypothesis.

The two variants could lead to different results if the observations of group B affect the estimation of `_b[1.treatment]`. Sometimes this can be good; for example, if your regression includes control variables and their coefficients become more precisely estimated when the full sample is used. In turn, the more precisely estimated control variable coefficient improves the estimate `_b[1.treatment]`, which could be advantageous.


### <a name="output"></a>How to I read the output?
I will use this example output to explain all elements:
```
 0: ritest treatment _b[treatment]/_se[treatment], reps(500) strata(block): areg outcome treatment, r abs(block)
 1:      command:  areg outcome treatment, r abs(block)
 2:        _pm_1:  _b[treatment]/_se[treatment]
 3:  res. var(s):  treatment
 4:   Resampling:  Permuting treatment
 5:Clust. var(s):  __000000
 6:     Clusters:  99
 7:Strata var(s):  block
 8:       Strata:  4
 9:
10:------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11:T            |     T(obs)       c       n   p=c/n   SE(p) [95% Conf. Interval]
12:-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
13:       _pm_1 |   2.362446      14     500  0.0280  0.0074  .0153906   .0465333
14:------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15:Note: Confidence interval is with respect to p=c/n.
16:Note: c = #{|T| >= |T(obs)|}
```
1. The full command that is re-estimated at every iteration
2. The statistic that is evaluated after each run of the command
3. The variable that is be permuted/re-sampled
4. A string indicating how the variable is permuted/re-sampled
5. The variable that identifies treatment clusters. If none are given Stata will show the name of a tempvar here (`__000000`)
6. The number of different clusters.
7. The variable that identifies treatment strata.
8. The number of strata
9. The main table
  * `T(obs)` The realization of the test statistic in the data
  * `c` the count of under how many of the re-sampled assignments, the realization of the test-statistic was more extreme than `T(obs)`
  * `n` the overall count of re-samplings
  * `p=c/n` the actual RI-based p-value, measuring the fraction of extreme realizations
  * `SE(p)` the standard error of that p-value estimate, based on the "sample" of `n` re-samplings. This does not say much about whether your hypothesis has to be rejected or not and it is mainly a function of how many permutations you choose.
  * `95% Conf. Interval` this too is an estimated confidence interval *for the p-value*, i.e. by choosing the number of re-samplings large enough, this can be made arbitrarily tight.
  
Finally, the notes indicate which hypotheses is tested. It can be changed by choosing an option to estimate one-sided p-values.



### <a name="cis"></a>How to get confidence bands?
Alwyn Young [describes here](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/YoungA/RandomizationConfidenceIntervals.pdf) how to find confidence bands for treatment effect estimates (others  discussed this before him, however the paper does a lot more and also gives a nice overiew - I definitely recommend reading it). This involves identifying the set of hypothesized treatment effects that cannot be rejected at a given level. This process can be implemeted by an iterative grid search in Stata. The code below gives a simplistic example of how this could be done with ritest. For a detailed discussion, caveats, and assumptions I recommend consulting [Alwyn Young's Paper](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/YoungA/RandomizationConfidenceIntervals.pdf).

Example code:
```
//generate mock data
set seed 123
clear
set obs 100
gen treatment = _n>_N/2 //half are treated
gen y = 0.3*treatment + rnormal() //there's a treatment effect
reg y treatment //this is the standard ols result

//run ritest to find which hypotheses for the treatment effect in [-1,1] can[not] be rejected
tempfile gridsearch
postfile pf TE pval using `gridsearch'
forval i=-1(0.05)1 {
	qui ritest treatment (_b[treatment]/_se[treatment]), reps(500) null(y `i') seed(123): reg y treatment //run ritest for the ols reg with the studentized treatment effect
	mat pval = r(p)
	post pf (`i') (pval[1,1])
}
postclose pf

//show results to illustrate confidence intervals
use `gridsearch', clear
tw line pval TE , yline(0.05)
```

The result will be a dataset of hypothesis tests and corresponding p-values. In this data it is easy to see for which hypothesized treatment effects, the null can be rejected, i.e., the confidence set.

Here I am plotting the p-value against the hypothesized treatment effect. The red line is at 5%, so that the area in which the p-value is higher than the red line corresponds to the 95% confidence set.
